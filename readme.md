# Sharpening your saw before cutting down the tree -- Personal development environment (PDE)
```

Pursuing a Ph.D. is a major commitment that requires a lot of hard work and
dedication. During this journey, students will have the opportunity to develop
important skills that are essential for research, such as critical thinking,
problem solving, writing, programming, time management, collaboration, and
communication. In addition to these skills, I would encourage students to take
the time to develop their personal development environment (PDE) and refine
their optimal workflow. To help with this, I will showcase some useful tools
such as a text editor (e.g. Neovim), AI tools like ChatGPT and Github Copilot,
and various utilities that can automate your workflow and make your research and
teaching more efficient and more enjoyable.
